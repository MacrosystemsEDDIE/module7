eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Forecast uncertainty is derived from multiple sources, including model parameters, driver data, among others. Knowing the uncertainty associated with a forecast enables forecast users to evaluate the forecast and make more informed decisions. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions and quantify forecast uncertainty. There are a number of approaches that forecasters can use to reduce uncertainty, which will be explored in this module."
module7,"In this module, we will address the following question: How can we use data to improve a forecast of lake algal biomass? We will address this question by building an ecological model to predict chlorophyll-a, generating ecological forecasts, and using data science approaches to integrate the most recently collected data into a forecast, a process known as data assimilation. We will explore how assimilating different types of data (e.g., chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, water temperature) at different frequencies (e.g., daily, weekly) affects forecast output. Finally, we will design an environmental monitoring program to inform ecological forecasts that are used by water resource managers."
goal,Develop a forecast which assimilates new data as it becomes available to improve our forecasts of lake algal biomass.

eco_forecast1,An ecological forecast is a prediction of future environmental conditions with uncertainty.
eco_forecast2,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems in response to environmental drivers such as weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area."

workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app. Students work in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Introduction"", ""Site Selection"", ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one (e.g., within Activity A, Objective 1 is ""Select and view site"")."
workflow2,There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which students can  input answers into.
workflow3,"When all of the objectives are completed and questions are answered, navigate to the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Introduction"" tab. This will then create a Microsoft Word document with all of the forecasts and answers embedded within, which can be downloaded and finalized before submitting to the instructor."
workflow4,"You can save your progress by downloading the user input before you leave the page (see ""Save your progress"" on this webpage for instructions on how to do this). This will allow you to return to this Shiny app and start from where you left off."
obj_01,"Select a NEON site from the table, then click on the """"View latest photo"""" button to load the latest image from that site. Follow the link at the bottom of the 'About Site' section to find out more about the site."
obj_02,Explore the data measured at the selected site. This is data that has been downloaded from the NEON Data Portal. The variables shown have been selected for this module but there are a wide range of variables collected at each NEON site.
obj_03,We will use chlorophyll-a sensor data to estimate primary productivity. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and biomass. Explore the options below to see if there are any relationships between chlorophyll-a and the other variables measured at your site. This information will be used to build your model.
obj_04,"Using your understanding of aquatic ecosystems, you will build a simple ecological model to predict primary productivity."
obj_05,"In ecological models, a “driver variable” is an input that is needed for a model to make predictions of a state variable. In the simplified aquatic food web model we are using today, water temperature and underwater light are the driver variables, and nitrogen and chlorophyll-a are the state variables. We are going to generate forecasts of chlorophyll-a as a proxy for aquatic primary productivity."
obj_06,Use the weather forecast data which has been converted into driving variables (surface water temperature and underwater light) to drive the simplified aquatic food web model to forecast primary productivity.
obj_07,"Congratulations! You have completed your first ecological forecast! Now, we are going to confront your forecast with data. Using a process known as “data assimilation”, we will repeat the forecast process while periodically updating our model initial conditions (chlorophyll-a and nitrogen) with new observations when they are available."

weather_forecast1,A weather forecast is probably the most widely used and applied forecast. Here we will examine the output from a weather forecast model from NOAA.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts use multiple simulations from the same model, but alters the initial conditions of the model to generate different potential futures."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real ecological phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly (e.g., the abundance of foxes in a forest)."
model2,"Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as, ""warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature"" or ""a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer""."
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton (NP) model is a common tool in freshwater and marine research. The NP model represents the simplest sets of processes needed to model plankton dynamics.
phyto_chla,"Phytoplankton are primary producers. They take up nitrogen and other nutrients to photosynthesize (i.e., use sunlight to make food from carbon dioxide and water). Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy (i.e. indirect measurement) of the phytoplankton concentration in water. We will use chlorophyll-a  sensor measurements from the lake and assume the concentration of chlorophyll-a is equal to the concentration of phytoplankton for the purposes of this module."
ens_mod1,Ensemble modelling is using multiple simulations to predict an outcome and to reduce the error of the prediction.
uncertainty,Uncertainty emerges from some kind of error or imperfection in our knowledge and understanding of the ecological system being investigated.
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variability in the environment and imperfect knowledge of an ecological system. When generating a forecast, uncertainty can come from the structure of the model used, the conditions the model is initialized with, and the data used to drive the model, among other sources."
uncert2,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. For example, taking replicate samples is one way to estimate uncertainty in observations  whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NP model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions that we know are simplistic representations of reality. One such assumption is that phytoplankton nutrient uptake occurs at a constant parameter rate. It is known that many different species of phytoplankton take up nitrogen at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for all phytoplankton. In addition to process (model) uncertainty, observational uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty, other sources of uncertainty are drivers and initial conditions."
why_important,Knowing the uncertainty in a forecast allows forecast users to make informed decisions based on the potential future scenarios and prepare accordingly.
mod_selec_uc,Model selection uncertainty is due to not knowing which model best represents the variable you are predicting. It is often unaccounted for when only one model is used.
driver_uncert,Driver uncertainty comes from inaccuracies in the forecasted variables used to drive the model.
proc_uc,Process uncertainty is uncertainty caused by our inability to model all processes as observed in the real world.
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
state_var,"State variables are those that give a snapshot of the system's properties at any single point in time. The phytoplankton biomass and nutrient concentration of an ecological model are examples of this. You can measure them, and you don't need any information about precisely how the system arrived in its current state."
parameter,A parameter is a value in a model that  describes the rate of change in those states.
fc_cycle_end,"We have now stepped through each of the steps in the forecast cycle. As you can see, forecasting is an iterative process. We constantly will need to generate forecasts of the future as time moves forward. When we combine our forecasts with data, we can use this data to update our model, which will then improve our model the more forecasts we make. This is one of the key advantages of ecological forecasting."

distribution,"A parameter distribution shows the possible values for a parameter value and how often they occur. For example, a normal distribution of a parameter has a bell-shaped curve, and the median is the most likely value of that parameter."
r_squared," is a goodness-of-fit measure for linear regression models. This statistic indicates the amount of variation in the dependent variable that the independent variable was able to correctly  explain. R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between your model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 to 1 scale, where 0 means that no variation in the independent variable is explained by the dependent variable, and 1 means that all variation in the independent variable is explained by the dependent variable."
std_error,The standard error of the coefficient measures how precisely the model estimates the coefficient's unknown value. It is the standard deviation around the estimate of the parameter and can be visualized by drawing a normal distribution with the mean as the parameter estimate and the standard error as the standard deviation.
density_plots,Density plots are used to observe the distribution of a variable in a dataset.
linear_relationship,"A linear relationship is a statistical term used to describe a straight-line relationship between two variables. Linear relationships can be expressed either in a graphical format where the variable and the constant are connected via a straight line or in a mathematical format where the independent variable is multiplied by the slope coefficient, added by a constant, which determines the dependent variable. "
mod_error,Model error is the difference between an observation and the estimate value from the model.

uc_quant1,Uncertainty quantification is the science of quantitative characterization and reduction of uncertainties in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known.
tps1,"With your partner, each of you select two  of the four models (make sure you select different models) and explore how uncertainty differs between the models. Complete the activities below by yourself and then discuss with your partner to answer Q. 27."
mgmt_scen1,For this activity you are a Water Resource Manager for the local hydroelectric dam which provides water to agricultural users downstream and energy to the local town.
mgmt_scen2,"During the summer, water temperatures at the surface increase, while temperatures at the bottom increase much slower creating a difference in temperature between the surface and the bottom."
mgmt_scen3,This reservoir can release water either from near to the surface of the dam or from the bottom of the dam.
mgmt_scen4,Fish downstream of the dam are influenced by stream water temperature.
mgmt_scen5,You will make decisions about where the water should be withdrawn for the next 7-days to optimize survival rates for Chinook salmon based on water temperature forecasts for surface and bottom temperatures within the reservoir.
data_assimilation,"Data assimilation is the process of fusing models and data. In ecological forecasting, data assimilation is the process of updating ecological forecasting models with new environmental data as they become available."
da_uncertainty,"The amount of uncertainty in model predictions and data determines how much we adjust our forecasts based on new observations. If we observe a new data point and we have low observation uncertainty, our forecast starting conditions will be adjusted to closely correspond to the new observation. If we observe a new data point and we have high observation uncertainty, our forecast starting conditions will not be adjusted as much."
da_freq,"More frequent observations allow us to update our forecast models more often, potentially improving forecast accuracy."
