<p>Lake Suggs (SUGG) is an aquatic NEON field site located in Putman County, Florida about 20 miles east of Gainesville. It is part of the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS), a 38.5 km<sup>2</sup> (9500 acre) property owned and managed by the University of Florida as a biological research center. Suggs Lake is 0.73 km<sup>2</sup> (180 acres) in area. It is classified as a seepage lake dominated by groundwater flow with the local aquifer, but it is also fed by the local surface and subsurface flow through the wetland complex. The lake is situated on limestone geology overlain by a variable mixture of sand, gravel, clay, phosphate and carbonate sediments. The site is encompassed within the NEON Southeast Domain that is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. The Domain features a patchwork of forest, grassland and wetland communities embedded in a matrix that is increasingly dominated by a fast-growing human population. The Domain hosts five other NEON field sites, including two additional aquatic and three terrestrial sites, located in Florida and Georgia. SUGG is colocated with the OSBS terrestrial field site. The Barco Lake (BARC) aquatic site is also located within OSBS. [1] [2]</p>
