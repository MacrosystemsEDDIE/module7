Data collection method,Description of data frequency,Description of data latency
Thermistor,"If deployed in a lake, thermistor data can be collected at a high frequency (e.g., every minute or even more often).","Thermistor data may be streamed wirelessly from the lake to a computer. In cases where this is not possible, a human must travel to the lake, download the sensor data, and upload it to a computer upon return from the field. "
Temperature sonde,"Typically temperature sonde profiles are not collected every day as it requires a human to travel to the lake and take measurements. As a result, the frequency of these data can be highly variable, ranging from multiple times a week to only once a year.","Once measurements are taken, data must be downloaded from the sonde and uploaded to a computer or converted from a handwritten to a digital form."
Secchi disk,"Typically Secchi disk depth readings are not collected every day as it requires a human to travel to the lake and take measurements. As a result, the frequency of these data can be highly variable, ranging from multiple times a week to only once a year.","Once a measurement is taken, it must be converted from a handwritten to a digital form."
PAR sensor,"If deployed in a lake, PAR sensor data can be collected at a high frequency (e.g., every minute or even more often). ","PAR sensor data may be streamed wirelessly from the lake to a computer. In cases where this is not possible, a human must travel to the lake, download the sensor data, and upload it to a computer upon return from the field. "
Nitrate sensor,"If deployed in a lake, nitrate sensor data can be collected at a high frequency (e.g., every minute or even more often).","Nitrate sensor data may be streamed wirelessly from the lake to a computer. In cases where this is not possible, a human must travel to the lake, download the sensor data, and upload it to a computer upon return from the field. "
Laboratory analysis of water sample for nitrate,"Typically water samples are not collected every day as it requires a human to travel to the lake and take measurements. As a result, the frequency of these data can be highly variable, ranging from multiple times a week to only once a year.","It usually takes at least a week to conduct laboratory analyses of water samples for nitrate, and the process can be much longer (e.g., several weeks or months) depending on the resources available to the researcher."
Chl-a sensor,"If deployed in a lake, chlorophyll-a sensor data can be collected at a high temporal frequency (e.g., every minute or even more often).","Chlorophyll-a sensor data may be streamed wirelessly from the lake to a computer, resulting in low data latency. In cases where this is not possible, a human must travel to the lake, download the sensor data, and upload it to a computer upon return from the field, increasing latency."
Laboratory analysis of water sample for chl-a,"Typically, water samples are not collected every day as it requires a human to travel to the lake and take measurements. As a result, the temporal frequency of these data can be highly variable, ranging from multiple times a week to only once a year.","It usually takes at least a week to conduct laboratory analyses of water samples for chlorophyll-a, and the process can be much longer (e.g., several weeks or months) depending on the resources available to the researcher, resulting in high data latency."
