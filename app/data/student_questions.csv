q1,What is meant by the term 'data assimilation' in the context of ecological forecasting?,Introduction:
q2,How do you think the process of integrating the most recently observed data into models can improve forecasts? ,Introduction:
q3,Fill out information about your selected NEON site:,Site Selection: Objective 1
q3a,Name of selected site:,
q3b,Four letter site identifier:,
q3c,Latitude:,
q3d,Longitude:,
q3e,Lake area (km2):,
q3f,Elevation (m):,
q4,Scroll over the interactive plot to determine how frequently different types of data are collected. Fill out the table below with the collection frequency of the listed environmental variables. To edit the table you must double click the cell and then type in your answer.,Site Selection: Objective 2
q5,Why might some types of data be collected more frequently than others? Try to think of two reasons.,Site Selection: Objective 2
q6,Describe the effect of each of the following variables on chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy measurement for phytoplankton concentration and primary productivity in aquatic environments.,Site Selection: Objective 
q6a,Air temperature,
q6b,Surface water temperature,
q6c,Nitrogen,
q6d,Underwater PAR,
q7,Were there any other relationships you found at your site? If so please describe below.,
q8,Classify the following as either a state variable or a driver variable by dragging it into the corresponding bin.,
q9,We are using chlorophyll-a as a proxy of aquatic primary productivity. Select how you envision increases in each driver variable to affect chlorophyll-a concentrations:,
q9a,Increases in water temperature,
q9b,Increases in underwater light,
q10,List two ecosystem variables in lakes and inland water bodies that depend on water temperature., 
q11,How would developing forecasts of water temperature help us to generate forecasts for the variables you listed in Q.10?,
q12,Check out the forecast model you have estimated. Notice the 95% confidence interval which is generated using differences between water temperature observations and the estimated water temperature values from the model. How do you think the uncertainty associated with this water temperature model might affect a forecast of chlorophyll-a that relies on water temperature forecasts as input?,
q13,Which model has a lower RMSE?,
q14,"Based on your answer to Q.13, when using these linear regression models would you expect forecasts of water temperature or underwater light to have greater uncertainty?",
q15,"Using the information above, briefly characterize the relative amount of observation uncertainty associated with chl-a and nitrate sensors.",
q16,Make a hypothesis: how do you think a high level of observation uncertainty might affect the process of data assimilation into forecasts and forecast output?,
q17,Describe the effect of changes in observation uncertainty on your forecast output. Does this match your stated expectation from the previous question?,
q18,"Referring to the table above, what are some of the most common factors affecting how often data is available for assimilation into ecological forecasts?",
q19,"Make a hypothesis: how do you think the frequency of data assimilation might affect forecast output? Specifically, how do you think that a forecast which assimilates data once a month might differ from a forecast that assimilates data every day?",
q20,"Generate a forecast with data assimilation every 10 days for both chl-a and nitrate, and record the RMSE of the forecast.",
q21,"Generate a forecast with daily data assimilation for both chl-a and nitrate, and record the RMSE of the forecast.",
q22,Compare the RMSEs of forecasts when data is assimilated every day vs. when data is only assimilated every 10 days. How do they compare? What does this indicate about the effect of data assimilation frequency on forecast output?,
q23,Briefly explain the thought process behind the choices you made in designing your monitoring program in the context of the forecast scenario you selected (either Moore or Woelmer Reservoir),
q24,"Consider the reservoir monitoring program you have designed. How do you think observation uncertainty in your monitoring program will affect data assimilation and the accuracy of your future forecasts? If you need to review what we have learned about observation uncertainty, revisit Activity B, Objective 8.",
q25,"Consider the reservoir monitoring program you have designed. How do you think data collection frequency and data latency in your monitoring program will affect data assimilation and the accuracy of your future forecasts? If you need to review what we have learned about data collection frequency and data latency, revisit Activity B, Objective 9.",
