q1,Q1. What is meant by the term 'data assimilation' in the context of ecological forecasting?
q2,Q2. How do you think the process of integrating the most recently observed data into models can improve forecasts? 
q3,Q3. Fill out information about your selected NEON site.
q3a,a. Name of selected site:
q3b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q3c,c. Latitude:
q3d,d. Longitude:
q3e,e. Lake area (km2):
q3f,f. Elevation (m):
q4,Q4. Why might a forecast of lake chlorophyll-a concentration days to weeks into the future be a useful tool for water managers?
q5,Q5. Describe how chlorophyll-a changes over time in your lake. Do you notice any patterns or trends?
q6,"Q6. Explain, in your own words, how autocorrelation in a variable can help forecasters make predictions of the future."
q7,Q7. Describe what you observe on the timeseries figure of chlorophyll-a. How do the two lines plotted on the timeseries (chlorophyll and 1 day lag of chlorophyll) relate to each other?
q8,Q8. Describe what you observe on the scatterplot figure above. Do you think the chlorophyll-a data at your chosen lake site exhibit autocorrelation? Why or why not?
q9,Q9. Interpret the autocorrelation value you calculated; does this value indicate low or high autocorrelation between chlorophyll-a and a 1-day lag of chlorophyll-a?
q10,Q10. Describe how autocorrelation changes as the lag in days increases. Why do you think this pattern occurs?
q11,"Q11. Imagine you are asked to develop a forecasting model that uses lagged values of chlorophyll-a to predict future chlorophyll-a. Examining the autocorrelation plot above, how many lags of chlorophyll-a would you include in your forecasting model? Provide your answer in days (e.g., I would include up to a 3-day lag) and explain your reasoning."
q12,Q12. Examine the PACF plot. Which lag contributes the most to autocorrelation in the chlorophyll-a data? Explain how you know.
q13,"Q13. Once again, imagine you are asked to develop a forecasting model that uses lagged values of chlorophyll-a to predict future chlorophyll-a. Examining the PACF plot above, how many lags of chlorophyll-a would you include in your forecasting model? Provide your answer in days (e.g., I would include up to a 3-day lag) and explain your reasoning."
q14,Q14. Did the number of lags you chose to include in your forecasting model change from Q11 to Q13? Why or why not?
q15,Q15. Use the plot above to assess the model fit to data. How well do the predictions match the observations?
q16,Record the RMSE of your forecast with no data assimilation.
q17,Describe the predicted vs. observed plot for your forecast with chlorophyll-a data assimilation. How accurate do you think the forecast is?
q18,Record the RMSE of your forecast with chlorophyll-a data assimilation.
q19,"Using RMSE from the table above, choose the word that you think best completes the following sentence: ""Assimilating chlorophyll-a data will cause forecast accuracy to [increase, decrease, stay the same] compared to the forecast with no data assimilation."" Remember, a lower RMSE value indicates a more accurate forecast."
q20,"Using the table above, briefly characterize the relative amount of observation uncertainty associated with chl-a sensors and chl-a lab measurements."
q21,Make a hypothesis: how do you think a high level of observation uncertainty might affect the process of data assimilation into forecasts and forecast output?
q22,Describe the effect of changes in observation uncertainty on your forecast output. Does this match your stated expectation from the previous question?
q23,"Referring to the table above, what are some of the most common factors affecting how often data are available for assimilation into ecological forecasts?"
q24,"Make a hypothesis: how do you think the frequency of data assimilation might affect forecast output? Specifically, how do you think that a forecast which assimilates data once a month might differ from a forecast that assimilates data every day?"
q25,"Generate a forecast with chl-a data assimilation every 10 days, and record the RMSE of the forecast."
q26,"Generate a forecast with daily data assimilation for chl-a, and record the RMSE of the forecast."
q27,Compare the RMSEs of forecasts when data are assimilated every day vs. when data are only assimilated every 10 days. How do they compare? What does this comparison indicate about the effect of data assimilation frequency on forecast output?
q28,What are some characteristics of environmental data that would make data easier or harder to assimilate into forecasts? Explain your reasoning.
q29,What are some characteristics of environmental data that would lead to the greatest improvement in forecast accuracy when those data are assimilated? Explain your reasoning.
q30,Briefly explain your decision to purchase either Sensor A (cheap sensor) or Sensor B (expensive sensor).
q31,"Based on the forecast presented here, would managers of Green Reservoir issue a drinking water warning for Oct. 27?"
q32,"Based on the forecast presented here, would managers of Green Reservoir issue a drinking water warning for Oct. 27?"
q33,"Based on the forecast presented here, would managers of Green Reservoir issue a drinking water warning for Oct. 27?"
q34,How did the management decision made using a forecast with no sensor compare to the decision made using a forecast with Sensor A (cheaper sensor)?
q35,How did the management decision made using a forecast with no sensor compare to the decision made using a forecast with Sensor B (expensive sensor)?
q36,How did the management decision made using a forecast with Sensor A (cheaper sensor) compare to the decision made using a forecast with Sensor B (expensive sensor)?
q37,"Now that you can see forecasts generated with each sensor as well as all the data collected during the forecast period, would you change your recommendation to the water authority about which sensor to use? Why or why not?"
