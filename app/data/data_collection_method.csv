Water temperature,Thermistor,"A thermistor is a temperature sensor which is usually installed at a fixed depth (e.g., 1 meter below the water surface) in a lake.","Some thermistors are more precise than others, but in general thermistor observation uncertainty is relatively low compared to measurements of many other environmental variables.",26.20 ± 0.01 degrees C
Water temperature,Temperature sonde,"A temperature sonde is a temperature sensor which can be lowered through the water on a cable, giving a temperature profile across several depths in a lake. Typically, these sensors are operated by a human who travels to the lake to take measurements rather than being deployed and left out in the lake.","Like thermistors, temperature sondes are also relatively precise, but there is some error associated with the time it takes for the sonde to adjust to the temperature at each depth (equilibration). If a human tries to collect a temperature profile too quickly and does not permit time for equilibration, readings may be less accurate.",26.2 ± 0.1 degrees C
Underwater light,Secchi disk,A Secchi disk is lowered through the water column until the black and white pattern on the disk can no longer be seen. The depth at which the pattern disappears gives an estimate of how far light is penetrating into the water column. The depth at which the pattern disappears can be converted into an estimate of underwater light using an equation.,"Because the depth at which a Secchi disk pattern disappears depends on the eyesight of the user, these readings can be variable. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the equation used to convert Secchi disk depth to underwater light.",The depth at which only 1% of surface light is remaining is 1.5 ± 0.2 meters. 
Underwater light,PAR sensor,"A photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor is a light-sensing device that can either be installed just above the surface of a lake, within a lake at a fixed depth, or lowered through the lake while attached to a cable. ","Uncertainty can be introduced by several means. For example, uncertainty can result from the conversion of above-water PAR readings to below-water PAR readings. In addition, uncertainty can result from sensor fouling by, for example, a biofilm growing on the light-sensing device, or if a light profile is taken in partly cloudy conditions with clouds intermittently shading the sensor. Nonetheless, PAR sensor readings tend to be more precise than calculating underwater light from Secchi disk depth.",250 ± 10 umol m2 sec^-1
Nitrate,Nitrate sensor,Nitrate sensors measure the light absorption of different wavelengths in the water column and convert this information to an estimated nitrate concentration. Nitrate sensors are typically installed at a fixed depth in a lake or are lowered through the water column on a cable.,"As with many optical sensors, accuracy may be affected by the presence of substances that alter water color, such as suspended sediment or dissolved organic matter. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the equation that converts absorption at different wavelengths to nitrate concentration.",
Nitrate,Lab analysis of water sample,"Nitrate measurements can be obtained through laboratory analysis of water samples. A commonly used method involves spectrophotometry, in which several chemicals are added to a water sample to cause a color change that intensifies as the concentration of nitrate increases. The color intensity can then be converted to an estimated nitrate concentration in the water sample.","As with many laboratory analyses, it is difficult to detect very low concentrations of nitrate or very small changes in concentration. So the relative uncertainty associated with this method depends on the range of nitrate concentrations that are observed in a particular lake. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the equation to convert color intensity to nitrate concentration. ",15 ± 3 ug/L
Chl-a,Chl-a sensor,"Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) sensors use fluorescence to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a, an important photosynthetic pigment in algal cells, in water. The sensor sends a beam of light into the water column and measures how much light is fluoresced back to the sensor by chlorophyll-a in algal cells. This fluorescence intensity is then converted to an estimate of chlorophyll-a concentration. Chlorophyll-a sensors are usually either deployed at a fixed depth in a lake or lowered through the water column on a cable.","As with many optical sensors, accuracy may be affected by the presence of substances that alter water color, such as suspended sediment or dissolved organic matter. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the equation that converts fluorescence to chlorophyll-a concentration. However, chlorophyll-a sensor readings tend to be more precise than laboratory analysis of water samples for chlorophyll-a, yet are more expensive to deploy. ",15.6 ± 0.1 ug/L
Chl-a,Lab analysis of water sample,Chlorophyll-a concentration can be measured by laboratory analysis of water samples. Processed samples are inserted into a spectrophotometer that uses the absorption of light at a wavelength of 665 nm to estimate the chl-a concentration in the water sample.,"Water samples must be processed (transported back to lab and filtered) before they are inserted into the spectrophotometer. Errors in processing may increase uncertainty in observations. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the equation used to estimate chl-a concentration based on absorption. Consequently, these samples are more logistically challenging and time-consuming than sensor data, but are usually much less expensive to run.",15.6 ± 5 ug/L
