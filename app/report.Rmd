# **Macrosystems EDDIE Module 7: Using Data to Improve Ecological Forecasts**


# Learning Objectives:

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Define data assimilation (Activity A)
- Generate an ecological forecast for primary productivity (Activity A)
- Describe how to assess ecological forecast accuracy (Activity A)
- Describe how data assimilation affects forecast accuracy and uncertainty (Activity B)
- Explain how updating models with data collected at different time scales (e.g., daily, weekly) and with different levels of associated uncertainty affects ecological forecasts (Activity B, C)


# Why macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting?

**Macrosystems ecology** is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales (e.g., Heffernan et al. 2014). For example, _global_ climate change can interact with _local_ land-use activities to control how an ecosystem changes over the next decades. Macrosystems ecology recently emerged as a new sub-discipline of ecology to study ecosystems and ecological communities around the globe that are changing at an unprecedented rate because of human activities (IPCC 2013). The responses of ecosystems and communities are complex, non-linear, and driven by feedbacks across local, regional, and global scales (Heffernan et al. 2014). These characteristics necessitate novel approaches for making predictions about how systems may change to improve both our understanding of ecological phenomena as well as inform resource management.  

**Forecasting** is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting macrosystems dynamics. To anticipate and prepare for increased variability in populations, communities, and ecosystems, there is a pressing need to know the future state of ecological systems across space and time (Dietze et al. 2018). Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasts are a powerful test of the scientific method because ecologists make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; use the model to make a forecast of future conditions; and then when observations become available, assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated. Forecasts that are effectively communicated to the public and managers will be most useful for aiding decision-making. Consequently, macrosystems ecologists are increasingly using ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems are changing over space and time (Dietze and Lynch 2019).  

In this module, students will generate an ecological forecast for a NEON site and explore how to use ecological data to improve forecast accuracy. This module will introduce students to the concept of data assimilation within an ecological forecast; how data assimilation can be used to improve forecast accuracy; how the level of uncertainty and temporal frequency of observations affects forecast output; and how data assimilation can affect decision-making using ecological forecasts.  \

## Module overview:

- Introductory presentation to the concepts of ecological forecasting, forecast accuracy and uncertainty, and data assimilation
- Activity A: Access and explore data from an ecological site of your choice in the National Ecological Observatory Network, then fit a model and generate a forecast of lake chlorophyll-a
- Activity B: Explore how updating model predictions with data affects forecast accuracy, including the effects of data observation uncertainty and temporal frequency
- Activity C: Update forecasts with data that have different levels of observation uncertainty for making management decisions

## Today's focal question: _How can we use data to improve ecological forecasts?_

To be useful for management, ecological forecasts need to be both accurate enough for managers to be able to rely on them for decision-making and include a representation of forecast uncertainty, so managers can properly interpret the probability of future events. To improve forecast accuracy, we can update forecasts with observational data once they become available, a process known as data assimilation. Recent improvements in environmental sensor technology and an increase in the number of sensors deployed in ecosystems have increased the availability of data for assimilation to develop and improve forecasts for natural resource management.

In this module, you will explore how assimilating data with different amounts of observation uncertainty and at different temporal frequencies affects forecasts of lake water quality at an ecological site of your choice.
